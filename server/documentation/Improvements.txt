- Areas for Improvement and Enhancements:
   - 1. User Interface:
      - [x] Enhance the styling of the client interface for a more visually appealing look.
      - [x] Implement responsive design to ensure the interface adapts well to different screen sizes.

   - 2. Error Handling:
      - Implement error handling mechanisms for the server and client to gracefully handle any unexpected errors.
      - Display meaningful error messages to users in case of failures or connection issues.

   - 3. Input Validation:
      - Implement input validation on the client-side to prevent sending empty or invalid messages.
      - Validate the received messages on the server-side to ensure they meet certain criteria or format.

   - 4. Security:
      - Implement secure communication using SSL/TLS to encrypt the WebSocket connection.
      - Apply input sanitization and filtering to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

   - 5. Logging and Analytics:
      - Improve the logging mechanism to capture more detailed information, such as timestamps and client details.
      - Integrate analytics tools to track usage patterns, user interactions, and performance metrics.

   - 6. Error Reporting:
      - Implement an error reporting mechanism to collect and log errors on both the client and server sides.
      - Consider integrating with logging services or error tracking platforms for efficient error monitoring.

   - 7. Scalability and Performance:
      - Optimize the server code for better performance, such as reducing unnecessary computations or improving algorithms.
      - Implement load balancing techniques to distribute incoming WebSocket connections across multiple server instances.

   - 8. Real-Time Features:
      - Expand the functionality of the WebSocket server to support additional real-time features, such as presence status, notifications, 
         or chat rooms.
      - Explore WebSocket extensions or protocols to enhance the capabilities of the WebSocket communication.

   - 9. Testing:
      - Develop comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the server and client code.
      - Consider implementing automated testing workflows and continuous integration for efficient testing processes.

   - 10. Documentation:
      - Improve the documentation of the codebase, including inline comments, code structure, and API documentation.
      - Create user guides or tutorials to assist users in understanding and utilizing the WebSocket client and server effectively.
